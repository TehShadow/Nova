# Nova: Offline Virtual Assistant

Nova is an offline voice-activated virtual assistant built using:

- **Vosk** for speech recognition
- **Piper** for text-to-speech (TTS)
- **Ollama + Mistral** (or other LLMs) for natural language understanding

Nova continuously listens for speech, interprets commands using a local LLM, and responds with spoken output. It supports calling real Python functions when prompted.
